    "The history of Chinese Americans or the history of ethnic Chinese in the United States includes three major waves of Chinese immigration since the 19th century, and they have been discriminated in many ways and even they had laws against the chinese, for example about the entry into the country. According of the 2010 United States Census, there were more than 3.3 million Chinese in the United States, which means about 1% of the total population and the biggest community outside  Asia, and this number is increasing. They have neighborhoods in many cities of USA, and New York City is not an excepction. \n",

    "In this capstone project i used differents types of data sources to get insights about the facts to consider to open a new chinese restaurant, considering that the chinese food is very appreciated worlwide, and even with the current panic about the diseases related with China this trend doesnt seem to change in the future"
